# Chrome-JS-Max-Background-Performance

A simple .BAT script for Windows that launches Chrome in high-performance mode.<br><br>
So if Chrome gets minimized or the screen gets locked, Chrome will still execute JavaScript scripts with the highest possible performance.<br><br>
Works also for Windows RDP sessions.
